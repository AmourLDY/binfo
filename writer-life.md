How can you live without story to tell. What I Personally enjoy is hearing  people talking about their life and career. So now I will share mine. Things about my education, my work experience, and how I finally become a self-employed tech writer today. 

My name is Peter, and I am a

## Area of Expertise

Before everything, I am a software developer, that's how I made a living since the begining or my career. I find it important to have your area of expertise in order to be a full time writer.

Firstly a bit on my education experience. I started my under graduate life in 2001, the university is named Hebei University of Science and Technology, and my major was automation engineering. Later in 2006, I became a graduate student in North China Electric Power University, and the major was Computer Science, that was, we make smart devices for power plants.

When I left school, I got a day job like most people. I spend a short period of time in Lenovo, and then went to work on Asianux Project, Asianux is Join Venture with members like American company Oracle, Japanese company Miracle Linux, China Academy of Science, and also some companies from Tailand and Vietnam. I did't even know how we made money, it is a government supported project, but we had people from many countries in the office, so we use English as language for work. BTW. Aisanux was a Operating system, like windows. My job there is writing code to build the system updater.

So yes I am a developer, and more precisely, I am a coder. You can find my source code at https://github.com/happypeter 。And I am a computer scientist, focusing on Web App, Crytography and Blockchain, all my work is about building a stronger Internet. And I hold a stong Passion for Technology.

## Publishing Content on Web

I loved building software, and I also found it's fun to share what I could do with people, so I started to make blogs and videos since 2012.

So I left my job, and started to do videos full time. I shared my videos for free by pulishing them on my website. I did one video each week. Taking that as a full time job means I did not have any income, so I moved back to Shijiazhuang, cause it's cheaper to rent a apartment there.  

My video is usually short and useful.  I call my self a profession explainer. I explain some difficult concepts to people, or showing people how to make sth useful step by step.

It's kind of crazy, but looking back, it was the best decision I've ever made. By sharing stuff on the web, I got my reputation, many people in my area knows about me. That turned out to be really important for my career.

## Building Connections

Working for other people is not for me, I love freedom, and I wanted to work for myself. In order to survive this way, I need to get my own connections.

I went to all kinds of meetups and conferences. Two things are really important, NO.1 have your own field, have your area of expertise, otherwise there is not so much you can talk with people. NO.2 better to have people know you before hand, and as I said the best way to build your reputation is by sharing content on web, by helping people to learn things in your area.

Some of those people will like you want to work with you. For example, imooc.com reached me and wanted me to do video courses for them, so I get paid to do what I love. you can find the stuff I made for them at https://www.imooc.com/search/?words=happypeter 。Besides that, I also do consulting, that is to do training or developing.

Since last year, I was sponsored, so I no longer do contracting since early last year. I feel so lucky to be able to do writing everyday.

## Conclusion

To conclude, It takes there steps before being a writer. Fistly, find your area, secondly, buid your reputation by publishing content online, lastly have enough connections with people who love you and want to support you.
